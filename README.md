# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description

This little game starts with player using x. Once player chooses a square, it will update the x on that square. Then it will say that player O is next. Once one player completes a line or a diagonal, the board will say exclaim who the winner is. 

## Roadmap to Future improvements

In the future I would like for the whole board to be disabled once someone wins. I would also like to add a restart button that resets the whole thing.
